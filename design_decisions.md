# Design Decisions

## Approach
For this Anagram Finder program, I implemented a solution based on the following key design principles:

### 1. Hash-based Grouping
I chose to use a hash map data structure (HashMap in Java) to group anagrams efficiently. This approach has several advantages:
- **O(1) lookups**: Checking if a word belongs to an existing anagram group is very fast
- **Natural grouping**: The map automatically groups words with the same sorted character key
- **Space efficiency**: Each unique set of characters is stored only once as a key

### 2. Character Sorting as Key
To identify anagrams, I sort the characters of each word to create a canonical form:
- All anagrams of a word will have the same sorted form (e.g., both "act" and "cat" become "act")
- This creates a reliable, unique key for each set of anagrams
- Sorting is an O(n log n) operation, where n is the word length (typically small)

### 3. Streaming File Processing
I implemented file reading in a streaming manner:
- Processes one line at a time without loading the entire file into memory
- Suitable for processing large files that don't fit in memory
- Uses buffered reading for better I/O performance

### 4. Single-pass Algorithm
The solution only requires a single pass through the input data:
- Reads each word once and immediately assigns it to an anagram group
- No need for multiple iterations over the data

## Maintainability Considerations

### Code Organization
- **Modular design**: Separated distinct operations into focused methods
- **Clear naming**: Method and variable names that describe their purpose
- **Error handling**: Basic error handling for common failure scenarios

### Extensibility
The solution is designed to be easily extended:
- Additional preprocessing of words could be added
- Output formatting can be modified independently of the core algorithm
- Alternative grouping strategies could be implemented by changing the key generation

## Performance Analysis

### Time Complexity
- File reading: O(n) where n is the number of words
- Character sorting: O(m log m) for each word, where m is the word length
- Overall complexity: O(n * m log m)

### Space Complexity
- O(n) space required to store all words
- In practice, space usage is close to the size of the input file plus overhead for the hash map

## No External Libraries
I chose not to use any external libraries beyond the standard libraries of Java:
- **Simplicity**: The solution is straightforward to understand and deploy
- **Portability**: No additional dependencies to manage
- **Adequate functionality**: Standard libraries provide all necessary components

# Scalability Considerations

## Handling 10 Million Words
The current solution can handle 10 million words with some adjustments:

1. **Memory Management**:
   - The current in-memory approach would still work for most modern systems
   - A typical desktop with 8-16GB RAM should handle this scale
   - Assuming average word length of 8 characters, 10 million words would require roughly 80MB for raw data, plus overhead for hash map structures

2. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Use more efficient I/O with larger buffer sizes
   - Consider parallel processing for file reading and word processing on multi-core systems
   - Optimize string handling to reduce object creation (e.g., using StringBuilder in Java)

## Scaling to 100 Billion Words
For 100 billion words, significant changes would be required:

1. **External Sorting and Partitioning**:
   - Implement a multi-stage processing approach
   - First pass: Partition data based on hash ranges to create manageable chunks
   - Process each partition independently, potentially on different machines

2. **Distributed Processing Framework**:
   - Use a framework like Apache Hadoop or Spark
   - Map phase: Read words, compute sorted keys
   - Reduce phase: Group by keys and output anagram sets
   - This naturally distributes both computation and memory requirements

3. **Database-Backed Solution**:
   - Use a database (relational or NoSQL) to store intermediate results
   - Process the file in chunks, writing results to database
   - Query database to generate final output
   - Consider using a distributed database for horizontal scaling

4. **Streaming Processing**:
   - Implement streaming algorithms that don't require holding all data in memory
   - Output partial results as processing progresses
   - Merge partial results in a separate phase

5. **Implementation Changes**:
   - Replace in-memory hash map with disk-based structures or databases
   - Implement custom external sorting algorithms
   - Add checkpointing to allow resuming of interrupted processing
   - Use memory-mapped files for more efficient file access

## Specific Implementation for Extreme Scale

For 100 billion words, I would implement a solution with the following components:

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Partition input file into smaller chunks (e.g., 1GB each)

2. **First-Pass Processing**:
   - For each chunk, generate (sortedKey, word) pairs
   - Write these pairs to temporary files, grouped by hash ranges

3. **Partitioned Processing**:
   - Process each hash range partition independently
   - For each partition, load (sortedKey, word) pairs
   - Group by sortedKey and write anagram groups to output files

4. **Result Consolidation**:
   - Combine the output files into the final result

This approach would be highly scalable as:
- Memory usage is bounded by the chunk size, not total file size
- Processing can be distributed across multiple machines
- I/O is optimized through sequential reading and writing
- Fault tolerance can be built in through restart capabilities

The key insight is to move from an in-memory algorithm to an external, partition-based algorithm that can scale horizontally across computing resources.
